# Environments from YT

### LRCubeRL
Learning Rubik's Cube with Reinforcement Learning
* [Code](https://github.com/riveSunder/lrcuberl)

### CARLE
Cellular Automata reinforcement learning environment
* [Code](https://github.com/rivesunder/carle)
* [Blog post: How to break your random network distillation](https://rivesunder.gitlab.io/rl/2019/08/24/breaking_rnd.html)

### RL Simple Games
Real simple games, like tic-tac-toe and hexapawn.
* [Code](https://github.com/riveSunder/rl-simple-games)

* Notes: This is a collection of low-complexity games built as RL environments. The environments are part of a nascent project to build a [game agnostic game learner](https://github.com/riveSunder/game-agnostic)

### Open Safety Gym
Coming Soon!
 
# Cool and Little-Known Environments

### balance-bot by yconst
* [Code](https://github.com/yconst/balance-bot)
* Blog [part I](https://backyardrobotics.eu/2017/11/27/build-a-balancing-bot-with-openai-gym-pt-i-setting-up/), [Part II](https://backyardrobotics.eu/2017/11/29/build-a-balancing-bot-with-openai-gym-pt-ii-the-robot-and-environment/)
* Notes: This environment is part of a tutorial on building an RL environment using the open source [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org) physics engine. The task is a self-balancing robot that must learn to stay upright. I haven't experimented with the environment yet, but the tutorial on building robots with PyBullet is really useful. If that sounds interesting you'll also want to dive into the [PyBullet quickstart guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit)
